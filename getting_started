# Getting Started

> To create TicTakToe you need functions to display the board, take in a user input and change the board accordingly
> Here are some functions you are going to have to understand in order to build the game
> It is easier if you divide the problem into smaller sub-problems

* Display the board - displayBoard()

* Ask user for the position of the board they want to change - positionChoice()

* Replace the old choice with the new user choice - replacementChoice()

* Ask user if they wish to continue playing - keepPlaying()
